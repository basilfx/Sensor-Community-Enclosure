# Sensor Community Enclosure
3D printed version of a Sensor.Community Air Sensor enclosure.

## Introduction
This repository contains the parts and assembly instructions for creating my
version of the [Sensor.Community](https://sensor.community/en/sensors/airrohr/)
Air Sensor. This sensor uses a relativly cheap PM2.5/PM10 sensor, to measure
the air quality. This data is then shared with
[Sensor.Community](https://maps.sensor.community/) and other instances, to
keep track of the (local) air quality.

## Features
* 3D printed parts (for the specific enclosure I used, +/- 80x120 mm)
* Rigid mounting with additional weather-proofing
* Air quality, temperature and GPS (location and altitude)

## Contents
* The `3d/` folder contains a 3D-printable designs for the necessary parts.
* The `firmware/` folder contains a compiled version of the Airrohr firmware I
  used (added for archiving reasons).
* The `images/` folder contains several pictures of the assembled sensor.

## Instructions
Assembly and flashing instructions can be found in
[Instructions.md](Instructions.md).
